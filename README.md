# Tweet Sentiment Classification
Tweet text classification project for positive and negative sentiment as part of the 2023 EPFL Machine Learning Course. Our team name on AIcrowd is [bert_simpson](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-ml-text-classification/teams/bert_simpson).

## Introduction
The goal of our project is to build a text classifier system to predict if a tweet message is used to contain a positive :) or negative :( smiley, by considering only the remaining text.
We implemented various preprocessing methods to handle the representation of our twitter datasets and we trained various models in order to best predict the sentiment of our tweets.

## Run Instructions
In order to run our preprocessing methods on our twitter datasets, we need to first download the raw twitter training and testing sets from [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-ml-text-classification/dataset_files). Extract the zip and make sure all downloaded files are contained in a single top level `twitter-datasets` folder. Then, you can run the main python script.
