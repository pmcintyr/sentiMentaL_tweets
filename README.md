## Introduction
The goal of our project is to build a text classifier system to predict if a tweet message is used to contain a positive :) or negative :( smiley, by considering only the remaining text.
We implemented various preprocessing methods to handle the representation of our twitter datasets and we trained various models in order to best predict the sentiment of our tweets.
